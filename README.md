Launch
======

	php pokesniperswarner.php


By default it warns you when finding pokemon with IV >= 90 and it calls the API every 20 seconds.


You can change those values by adding arguments to the launcher :

* First argument is IV
* Second argument is timer

  	php pokesnipers.php 80 15


The program will call pokesnipers API every 15 secondes and warns when pokemon with IV >= 80 are found.

You can't set the timer lower than 15 seconds, it's to avoid spam and too many requests on the API.


Happy pokemon hunting !
